### <a name="multiskill">DFF Project thematic AI, MultiSkill: Multilingual Information Extraction for Job Posting Analysis (2020-2024)</a>

Job markets are about to undergo profound changes in the years to come. The skills required to perform most jobs will shift significantly. This is due to a series of interrelated developments in technology, migration and digitization. As skills change, we are facing increasing needs for quicker and better hiring to better match people to jobs. Big multilingual job vacancy data are emerging on a variety and multitude of platforms. Such big data can provide insights on labor market skill set demands. This project is centered around computational job market analysis, to reliably perform high-precision information extraction on targeted domain data.
